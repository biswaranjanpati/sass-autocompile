I have faced lots of issues while using the Atom Sass-Autocompiler. 
This is my SCSS folder architeture


Index.html

CSS   |
      |  main.css
      
SASS  |
      |  main.scss        (  @import "_element.scss";   @import "_helper.scss";  )
      |  _elements.scss   (  add on first line /* main : ../CSS/base.scss*/   ) //  this points this SCSS file to main.scss
      |  _helper.scss     (  add on first line /* main : ../CSS/base.scss*/   ) //  this points this SCSS file to main.scss
      
      
 
 On changing the elements.scss or helper.scss it will update the main.css file. This is the setting you all have to do
 
 Click on setting on Autocompiler and enable these things...
 1. Compile on save
 2. Compile with 'expanded' output style
 3. On filename pattern for 'expanded' compiled files mention the path, i.e ../CSS/main.css //this is for my case
 
 you are on.....enjoy
